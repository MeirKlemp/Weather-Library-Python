hii 
need to do a mini project on python


Weather Data Library 
You should develop a library (similar to yahoo_finance), that allows other developers to retrieve weather data about specific location in our world. When something goes wrong, an exception should be raised in order to allow the other developer that chose to use your library to get more information and handle the exception properly. You can use the free web services at https://openweathermap.org. 


Phase #1 Define the new exception class specifically for this project. Make sure to allow new objects instantiated from this exception to represent the malfunction in a detailed way. 
a. Make sure the name of the new exception class ends with the word ‘Exception’.
b. Make sure that each object instantiated from this new exception type has attributes that include data about the malfunction.


  Phase #2 Define the Location class. Each object instantiated from this class represents a specific location on our planet. 


Phase #3 Define the Weather class. Each object instantiated from this class represents a specific weather using attributes, such as temperature, humidity, wind etc. This class should include the temperature attribute (at the minimum). 


Phase #4 
Define the getWeather global function in the new module. This new function should receive a reference for a Location object and return a reference for a Weather object. 


Phase #5
Develop a small program that demonstrates the use of the new library you developed.

1. need link for a video on youtube that shows  project working. The video should be either public or unlisted. The video should be 2 minutes length (max). You can use the CamStudio software
2.You can  send the files in a zip file
